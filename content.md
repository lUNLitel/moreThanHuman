# More than Human: BC Wildlife Ethics

Exploring Ethical Relationships with Wildlife

---

## Bear

**Subtitle:** Explore how bears live in and around Vancouver, why they matter, and what we can do to coexist ethically.

### Quick Facts

**Habitat:** Boreal and coastal forests, mountain valleys, riparian corridors.

**Diet:** Berries, salmon, roots, small mammals — seasonally varied.

**Role:** Seed dispersers, nutrient cyclers, keystone participants in forest ecology.

### A Day in the Life

The bear wakes at dawn and wanders along the stream. In summer it finds berries and salmon; in autumn it feeds to build fat for winter. Bears move nutrients from river to forest when they eat salmon and leave remains that fertilize trees and soil.

### Ethical Perspectives

#### Indigenous Knowledge System

Many Indigenous communities consider bears relatives and teachers. This view emphasizes responsibilities: humans must show respect, follow ceremonial protocols, and protect the habitats that sustain these relationships.

#### Ecocentrism

Protecting bears supports entire ecosystems: their feeding behavior affects plant communities and nutrient cycling. The ecosystem's health depends on protecting these interconnections.

#### Anthropocentrism

Bears are valued primarily for human benefit: wildlife tourism revenue, recreational hunting opportunities, and ecosystem services they provide. Public safety concerns and property protection often take priority, sometimes justifying relocation or removal when bears approach human settlements.

### Threats

- Habitat loss and fragmentation from development
- Human food attractants causing dangerous habituation
- Declining salmon runs and changing berry production from climate change
- Vehicle collisions and conflict-driven removal

### Interactive: Quick Flip Facts

**How do bears help forests?**
They transfer marine nutrients: When bears eat salmon, leftover carcasses feed soil and trees — strengthening forest growth.

**Why secure garbage?**
To prevent conflict: Accessible food leads to bears losing fear of humans and being removed or euthanized.

### What You Can Do

Small actions reduce harm and help bears keep their wild behaviors.

- Secure all garbage, compost, and pet food: use bear‑proof bins where available.
- Respect wildlife spaces: keep distance and never approach cubs.
- Support habitat corridors and local conservation groups.
- Drive carefully in wildlife crossing areas (dusk & dawn).

### Mini Quiz

**Question:** You see a bear near a picnic area eating food scraps. What should you do?

1. Take pictures up close — it's cool!
2. Slowly put the food away and try to shoo the bear.
3. Move to a safe distance, secure food, and notify park staff. ✓

## Deer

**Subtitle:** How do our choices shape the future of the deer?

### Quick Facts

**Habitat:** Forests, grasslands, and wetlands

**Diet:** Leaves, grasses, berries, and shrubs

**Ecosystem Role:** Seed dispersers, prey species supporting predators

### A Day in the Ecosystem

Deer move quietly through forests and meadows, shaping plant growth and providing essential balance to predator-prey relationships. Their presence affects plant diversity, soil health, and the survival of carnivores such as wolves and cougars. When deer populations are healthy, the landscape thrives alongside them.

### Ethical Perspectives

#### Indigenous Knowledge System

Many Indigenous cultures view deer as relatives, providers, and teachers. Ethical relations emphasize gratitude, respectful harvesting, and maintaining habitats that allow deer populations to flourish naturally. The relationship is reciprocal and grounded in responsibility.

#### Ecocentrism

Ecocentrism values deer as a key part of the broader ecosystem. Their grazing habits influence forest regeneration, and their interactions support predators and plant diversity. Ethical choices focus on maintaining ecological balance rather than human benefit.

#### Anthropocentrism

Under a human-centered view, deer are often seen through the lens of hunting, vehicle safety, or agricultural impacts. Policies may prioritize human needs—such as limiting deer populations to prevent crop damage or reduce road accidents.

### Threats & Human Impact

- Urban expansion reducing habitat
- Roadways causing increased collisions
- Climate shifts altering food availability
- Human overhunting or mismanagement of predator species

### Interactive: Quick Flip Facts

**How do deer shape forests?**
Through browsing and seed dispersal: Deer grazing influences which plants thrive and spread seeds through their movement and droppings.

**Why do deer need corridors?**
To move safely between habitats: Wildlife corridors reduce vehicle collisions and allow deer to access food and mates across fragmented landscapes.

### What You Can Do

Small actions can help protect deer and the ecosystems they support.

- Drive carefully near forested or rural areas
- Support habitat conservation programs
- Learn respectful harvesting and stewardship practices
- Advocate for wildlife corridors that reduce collisions

### Mini Quiz

**Question:** Why are deer important to their ecosystems?

1. They help maintain plant diversity and support predators ✓
2. They serve no ecological purpose
3. They only matter for hunting

## Salmon

**Subtitle:** How do our choices shape the future of the salmon?

### Quick Facts

**Habitat:** Rivers, streams, and the Pacific Ocean

**Diet:** Zooplankton, insects, small fish

**Ecosystem Role:** Transport nutrients from ocean to forest; support bears, eagles, forests

### A Day in the Ecosystem

Each year, salmon undertake one of the world's most remarkable migrations, returning from the ocean to their birthplace in freshwater streams. Their journey brings essential nutrients inland, feeding bears, wolves, eagles, and even the forests themselves. When salmon thrive, entire ecosystems flourish.

### Ethical Perspectives

#### Indigenous Knowledge System

Many Indigenous nations consider salmon to be relatives, teachers, and central to cultural identity. Practices emphasize reciprocity: taking only what is needed, honoring life cycles, and restoring rivers so salmon can continue their ancestral return. The salmon's value is relational, not merely economic.

#### Ecocentrism

Ecocentrism prioritizes the health of the entire watershed. Salmon are seen as a keystone species whose well-being reflects the overall integrity of rivers, forests, and coastal ecosystems. Protecting salmon means protecting everything linked to them.

#### Anthropocentrism

From a human-centered perspective, salmon are primarily valued for their economic and cultural importance. Fisheries, commercial markets, and food security shape decisions. This approach may justify hatcheries or river modifications to maintain human demand, even at ecological cost.

### Threats & Human Impact

- Rising river temperatures due to climate change
- Pollution from industrial and urban development
- Overfishing reducing population resilience
- Dams and barriers blocking migration routes

### Interactive: Quick Flip Facts

**Why do salmon swim upstream?**
To spawn where they were born: Salmon return to their birthplace to lay eggs, completing a cycle that connects ocean and forest ecosystems.

**How do salmon feed forests?**
Marine nutrients from ocean to land: Bears and other animals carry salmon into forests, enriching soil with ocean-derived nitrogen.

### What You Can Do

Small actions can help protect salmon and the ecosystems they support.

- Support sustainable seafood programs
- Learn about and respect Indigenous salmon stewardship practices
- Reduce plastic and chemical runoff
- Advocate for habitat restoration and dam removal

### Mini Quiz

**Question:** What happens when salmon return from the ocean to spawn?

1. They bring marine nutrients to forests and streams ✓
2. They only benefit commercial fisheries
3. They harm freshwater ecosystems
